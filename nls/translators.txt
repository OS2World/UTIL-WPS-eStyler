QUICK INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRANSLATORS

These directions assume you do not have access to the full eStyler and
GuidProc source in CVS.  (If you do have access, refer to the file
README.TXT in the estyler\nls directory for compilation instructions.)

Once you have translated the documentation and resource files, you will
need to send them to the eStyler source code maintainer, or someone else
who has the build environment for eStyler/GuidProc available.  This is
because compiling even the language files depends on having various header
files from both eStyler and GuidProc.
