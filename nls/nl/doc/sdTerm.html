   <title>Shutdown - programs termination list</title>
</head>
<body>

<br>
On system shutdown some programs do not behave correctly and just
refuse to quit so, to let the system being correctly closed, it is
necessary to use an appropriate utility to close them
(in such case the utility should be entered in
the <a href="sdPrograms.html">Shutdown programs</a> list) or to
recur to the <b>Termination</b> list feature to terminate
them via the DosKillProcess() API.
<p>
The <b>Terminate the following programs on shutdown</b>
checkbox enables/disables
the termination of the programs listed below.
<p>
The list of programs to be terminated, by default contains:
<ul compact>
<li>CHAT.EXE
<li>CLKBASIC.EXE
<li>CAD_POP.EXE
</ul>
New program names can be added by entering them in <b>entry field</b>
below the list and clicking on the <b>Add</b> button.
<p>
<b>Remove</b> deletes the selected program from the list.
<p>
When <b>Edit</b> is pressed, the selected program name is entered
in the entry field to let the user modify it. Once the program name
has been modified the <b>Add</b> button must be pressed again to
replace the name of the selected program with the new entry field
content.
<p>
<b>Find</b> opens the standard file dialog allowing the user to
find and select an executable name.
<p>
<b>Apply</b> saves the termination list to the eStyler.ini file,
while <b>Undo</b> restores the list to the state it was in when
the settings notebook was opened.
