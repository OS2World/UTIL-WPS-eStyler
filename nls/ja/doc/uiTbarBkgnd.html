<br>
The controls displayed in this group of settings vary according
to what is currently selected in the <b>Type of background</b>
drop down list.
<p>
<h3>Solid color background</h3><p>
When <b>Solid color</b> is selected there is only one sub-option:
the <b>Background color</b> button which displays a standard
<i>color wheel</i> control to let the user choose the titlebar background
color.
<p>
<h3>Gradient background</h3><p>
More options are available when the selected background type
is <b>Gradient</b>.
<p>
The <b>Gradient direction</b> drop down list selects the
kind of gradient: <i>Horizontal</i>, <i>Vertical</i>,
<i>Horizontal - double</i>,
<i>Vertical - double</i>.<br>
The preview window makes the distinction among these different
styles clearer than any possible descriptions as it is dynamically
updated according to the current selection.
<p>
The text of the <b>two color buttons</b> below the
<i>Gradient direction</i> drop down list varies according to the
current gradient style and should be self-explicative. In case
of doubt the user can just experiment and see the result in the
preview window.
<p>
The <b>Swap colors</b> button swaps the two gradient colors.
<p>
<h3>Bitmap background</h3><p>
<b>Bitmap</b> is the last available background type.
<p>
The <b>Background image</b> drop down lists the images available
in the Styler bitmaps folder.<br>
The preview window is dynamically updated as a new bitmap file is
selected.
<p>
The <b>Add a new image</b> button allows to import a new
bitmap file into the Styler bitmaps folder via the standard
file dialog.<br>
Valid bitmap files are OS/2 bitmaps of any format and color depth
provided that their size is less than 64 KB.<br>
If the bitmap file is an array of bitmaps only the first bitmap is
taken into account.
<p>
The <b>Scale the image</b> checkbox toggles the image rendering
mode between tiling and scaling.
