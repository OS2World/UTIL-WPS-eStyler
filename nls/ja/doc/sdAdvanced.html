<br>
<b>Warning:</b><br>
This dialog is only provided for trouble shooting purposes.
<p>
The enhanced shutdown features are performed by hooking in a standard
system shutdown to execute some extra functions.<br>
A proper shutdown may sometimes depend on the delays set
to allow the execution of the enhancements.<br>
In case the system does not succesfully complete the shutdown
it might be necessary to modify some delay values.<br>
In most cases, anyway, a failing shutdown is caused by a program
which doesn't respond correctly to the system shutdown and refuses
to quit. In such case you have to find the name of the offending
program and put it into the <a href="sdTerm.html">termination</a> list.<br>
As a rule of thumb, if the system shutdown hangs even if
the shutdown enhancements have been disabled,
then the problem lies with a single program,
otherwise the cause is the shutdown enhancements themselves.
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>
All the delays are in tenth of seconds (e.g. a value of 80
means 8 seconds).
<dl>
<dt><b>Lockup and suspend</b></dt>
<dd>various motherboards are not fully compatible with the
OS/2 advanced power management, so the system may hang if a
suspend command is issued while the mouse is moved.
The lockup and suspend delay ensures that the system is fully
locked up before being suspended.<br>
If you want to get a faster lockup and suspend just try to
set a lower delay until the system behaves correctly.<br>
If you do not use this feature you can ignore this setting.</dd>
<dt><b>Suspend</b></dt>
<dd>if your system hangs after you select <i>Suspend</i>
try to increase the delay to 20-30 or more.<br>
If you do not use this feature you can ignore this setting.</dd>
<dt><b>Save WarpCenter settings</b>
<dd>This delay lets the system save the WarpCenter settings.
If the system is quite fast this delay can be safely lowered to 3-4
or less.<br>
If you do not use the WarpCenter (SmartCenter) you can ignore this
setting.</dd>
<dt><b>Unroll windows</b></dt>
<dd>This delay allows any rolled windows to be unrolled on system
shutdown.<br>
Ignore this setting if you do not have the separate Styler/2 product
installed.<br>
If you do not use the Styler/2 roll-windows feature or have
a fast system you can safely lower this value to the minimum.</dd>
<dt><b>System shutdown message boxes</b></dt>
<dd>This delay prevents the system default shutdown boxes to appear
allowing for the substitution with the enhanced dialogs.<br>
If the system hangs on shutdown, you may try to change this value
by increasing or decreasing it.</dd>
<dt><b>DosKillProcess</b></dt>
<dd>This delay controls the interval that the enhanced shutdown
procedure will wait after executing <i>DosKillProcess</i> to stop
all programs in the termination list, before it calls <i>WinShutdownSystem</i>.
Some programs may take a few moments to terminate properly; if this occurs
with non-PM programs, they may interfere with the system shutdown.  You may
have to increase this value if the shutdown fails because one or more programs
is not being terminated in time.</dd>
<dt><b>WinShutdownSystem</b></dt>
<dd>This item delays the destruction of the <i>Window List</i>
window suspending so the execution of the <i>WinShutdownSystem</i> API.<br>
If the systems hangs on shutdown, try to reduce this value.<br>
If the systems doesn't correctly save its settings or desktop state
on power off or reboot, try to increase the value.
</dd>
<dt><b>DosShutdown</b></dt>
<dd>This setting applies only if you have chosen to add the ordinary
shutdown feature (listed just as <i>Shut down</i>) to the confirmation
dialog.<br>
This is the time to wait before displaying the box saying that the shutdown
is complete and that it is safe to switch off the system.<br>
If your machine is fast you can lower this value to the minimum.</dd>
<dt><b>Power off</b></dt>
<dd>This delay ensures that all the system settings and desktop
state are saved before the system is powered off.<br>
Owners of fast modern machines can lower this value.</dd>
<dt><b>Ok</b></dt>
<dd>This button saves the current settings and dismisses the dialog.</dd>
<dt><b>Cancel</b></dt>
<dd>This button dismisses the dialog without saving the current
settings.</dd>
<dt><b>Default</b></dt>
<dd>This button resets all the delay options to the default values.</dd>
