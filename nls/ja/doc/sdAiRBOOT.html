<a href="http://eComStation.ru/kiewitzsoft/">AiRBOOT</a>
is an advanced and feature rich boot manager created by
Martin Kiewitz.
<p>
To make the reboot feature cooperate with AiRBOOT, the following
requirements must be met:
<ol>
<li>AiRBOOT version 1.03 or newer must be installed.
<li>SETABOOT.EXE must be copied as SETBOOT.EXE in a directory listed in
the SET PATH directive of the CONFIG.SYS file, coming before the
\OS2 directory so that it overrides the \OS2\SETBOOT.EXE file.
<!-- The \ecs\bin path is probably the best solution. --><br>
Alternatively \OS2\SETBOOT.EXE can be renamed SETBOOT.IBM and
SETABOOT.EXE can be copied as SETBOOT.EXE in the \OS2 directory.
</ol>
