The shutdown confirmation dialog will display only the selected
shutdown options:
<ul>
<li><b>Lockup and suspend</b> allows to
automatically put the machine in suspension
mode after having locked up the desktop.<br>
Depending on the machine it might be necessary to move the mouse, hit the
space bar or push the power button to recover from the suspension
mode.<br>
Please refer to the desktop properties for more
informations and options regarding the <i>Lockup</i> feature.
<li><b>Suspend</b> puts the machine in suspension mode.<br>
Depending on the machine it might be necessary to move the mouse, hit the
space bar or push the power button to recover from the suspension
mode.
<li><b>Power off</b> automatically powers offs the machine.<br>
Unlike the <i>Power off</i> option, available via the context menu of
the <i>Power</i> object in the <i>System Setup</i>
folder, the enhanced <i>Power off</i> feature, besides allowing the
<a href="sdPrograms.html">execution</a> and the
<a href="sdTerm.html">termination</a> of the listed programs, correctly
saves the system settings and the desktop state
before the machine is switched off.
<li><b>Shut down</b> works exactly like the ordinary system shutdown
but still offering the options to run and terminate programs before
the system is closed.
<li><b>Reboot</b> allows you to directly reboot the machine, optionally
selecting a different boot volume.<br>
Unlike the reboot features offered by the SETBOOT.EXE program
(located in the \OS2 directory), the Styler reboot feature,
besides executing and terminating the listed programs,
saves all the system settings
and the desktop state before the machine is rebooted.
</ul>
<b>Note:</b>
<ul compact>
<li>The shutdown dialog appears whenever the user requests to shutdown
the system via the desktop menu, the WarpCenter, the XCenter or
the launchpad.
<li><i>Lockup and suspend</i>, <i>Suspend</i> and <i>Power off</i>
will work only if ACPI or APM support is enabled in CONFIG.SYS, and if
the corresponding driver fully supports the machine motherboard.
<li>If the system uses ACPI, be aware that not all OS/2 device drivers
properly support ACPI suspend and resume. This may prevent suspend from
working properly, or cause problems when waking up.
</ul>
