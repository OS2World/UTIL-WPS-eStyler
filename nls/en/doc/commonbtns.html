<br>
Various buttons can be displayed in the <i>common buttons area</i> of
the settings notebook.<br>
The visibility and enabled state of the buttons is automatically
updated according to the purpose of the top page and the current
state of the various settings it contains.
<p>
The <b>Apply</b> button, when visibled and enabled, generally refers
to all the settings contained in the current top page.<br>
The online help provides some note to warn the user of the exceptions
to this rule (e.g. the <i>Do not apply enhancements to:</i>
group of controls in the cover page of the <i>User interface</i> object).
<p>
The <b>Undo</b> button is enabled only when the state of the options
of the current page differs from the previous state, i.e. when the
notebook was opened.
<p>
The <b>Default</b> button is enabled only when any value of the current
settings differs from the default values.
<p>
The <b>Preview</b> button shows or hides the preview window in order
to let the user tune the current settings to his/her likes before applying
them.<br>
The <i>Preview</i> window is used only in the <i>User Interface</i>
settings notebook.
