   <title>Styler - User interface enhancements</title>
</head>
<body>

<br>
<b>Styler</b> improves both the aesthetics and the behavior
of some OS/2 Presentation Manager controls and of the system in
general.
<p>
The <b>User interface</b> object controls the
look of the title bars and push buttons and the font used by the dialog windows.
<p>
If one still prefers the old warp 4 style, it is possible to just uncheck the
<b>Enable user interface enhancements</b> checkbox or individually
disable the titlebar, button or dialog enhancements.
<p>
Besides that, the advanced look provided by eStyler can be selectively
disabled for a given set of applications.<br>
Use the entry field above the <i>Add</i>, <i>Remove</i> and <i>Find</i>
buttons to
enter the name of an executable file and the <b>Add</b> button
to add the new entry to the list.<br>
The <b>Remove</b> button removes the selected entries from the list.
<br>
The <b>Find</b> button displays the standard file dialog
and allows to directly add the selected file name to the list.
<p>
Once the list has been modified, the <b>Apply</b> button gets enabled
allowing to save the new entries and make eStyler aware of the changements.
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>
Enabling/disabling the user interface enhancements is performed as
soon as the state of the checkbox is changed: there is no
need to use the <i>Apply</i> button for that purpose.
<p>
The <a href="commonbtns.html">common buttons</a> documentation provides
some further informations about the <i>Apply</i> button and the other buttons
displayed in the <i>common buttons area</i> of the settings notebook.
