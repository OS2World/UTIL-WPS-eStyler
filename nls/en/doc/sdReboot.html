   <title>Shutdown - reboot</title>
</head>
<body>

<br>
Through the <b>Reboot</b> feature the system can be shut down
and then automatically rebooted to the selected volume.
<p>
Both the IBM Boot Manager and Martin Kiewitz's
<a href="sdAiRBOOT.html">AiRBOOT</a> are supported.
<p>
The Reboot page dialog allows to define the list of the rebootable
volumes to be displayed via the enhanced shutdown dialog.<br>
The volume list can be filled either manually or automatically.
<p>
<h3>Manual filling</h3><p>
The <b>Volume name</b> entry field must be filled with the volume name as
it appears on the BootManager or AiRBOOT menu, while the
<b>Volume description</b> field allows to associate to the volume
a more meaningful (and long) description.<br>
The shutdown confirmation dialog displays in a drop down box
only the volume descriptions in the order they appear in the
<i>Allow to reboot the following volumes</i> list.<br>
The two small <b>arrow buttons</b> on the left of the list allow
to change the items order moving up or down the selected item.
<p>
The <b>Add</b> button is enabled as soon as both the entry fields contain
some text. Once the button is clicked the fields content is added at the
end of the list as:<br>
<tt>volume description (volume name)</tt><br>
The <b>Remove</b> button removes an item from the list.<br>
The <b>Edit</b> button allows to change
the selected item volume name or description. Once it is clicked
the data of the selected item are put in the entry fields and the
<i>Add</i> button gets enabled to let the user update the selected item
as soon as the fields content has been changed.
<p>
<h3>Automatic filling</h3><p>
When the <b>Find</b> button is pressed the list of the bootable
partitions is directly read from the disk if AiRBOOT is installed
or through the LVM interface. Then, if the bootable volume is not
yet in the list it is added to the end of the list with the following
format:<br>
<tt>volume name (volume name)</tt></br>
i.e. the volume name is also used as volume description
and the user will have to use the <i>Edit</i> button to provide
it with a more meaningful description.
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>
If AiRBOOT is installed, the automatic detection of the bootable
volumes may fail if new volumes have just been added or deleted
via the LVM program as AiRBOOT updates its volume tables
only after a reboot.
<p>
<h3>Common buttons</h3><p>
The <b>Apply</b> button saves the new list to ESTYLER.INI.
<p>
<b>Undo</b> restores the list to the state it was in when the settings
notebook was opened.
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>
The extended shutdown dialog pre-selects the option
and re-bootable volume which were selected the last time, the dialog itself,
was dismissed through the OK button.
