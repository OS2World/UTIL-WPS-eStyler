   <title>Shutdown - shutdown programs list</title>
</head>
<body>

<br>
The enhanced shutdown allows to execute a list of
programs before the system is closed.
<p>
When <b>Run the following programs on shutdown</b> is checked,
the programs listed below are executed one by one. Only when
the execution of the last program ends, the previously opened windows
are closed and the system is shut down.<br>
If the program list is empty, the option is just ignored.<br>
<b>Note:</b><br>
The shutdown confirmation dialog allows to temporarely disable
or enable this feature via an <b>Execute shutdown programs</b>
checkbox.
<p>
The program names are entered via the <b>Program</b> entry field.<br>
If a program is situated in the <tt>PATH</tt> (i.e. is in a directory
listed in the PATH environment variable set in the CONFIG.SYS file),
only the program name is needed, otherwise it is necessary to specify
the full program path.<br>
If no extension is provided, the .EXE extension is
automatically appended to the program name.
<br>If the program is a REXX script or batch CMD file, its name is
automatically converted to:<br>
<tt>CMD.EXE /C filename.cmd options</tt><p>
If the REXX or batch file calls other programs, it will have to
do that in a synchronous way, i.e. not through any START or DETACH command,
otherwise it won't be possible to detect when each program terminates
and some files might not be properly saved.
<p>
Optional program parameters may be entered through the
<b>Parameters</b> field. This field must be left empty
if the program doesn't require any parameters.
<p>
The program visibility (normal, maximized or hidden), may be
set through the <b>Window</b> drop down box.
<p>
The two <b>arrow buttons</b> order the content of the program
list, moving the selected item up or down. They are automatically
enabled/disabled as suitable.
<p>
The <b>Add</b> button adds the current entry fields content to the
end of the list.
<p>
<b>Remove</b> deletes the selected item from the list.
<p>
<b>Edit</b> fills the entry fields with the data of the selected
item to let the user modify them. Once the data have been modified
the <b>Add</b> button is used to replace the selected item with
the new data.
<p>
<b>Find</b> opens the standard file dialog to let the user find and select
an executable name.
<p>
<b>Apply</b> saves the list data to the STYLER.INI file while
<b>Undo</b> restores the list content to the state it was in the
settings notebook was opened.
