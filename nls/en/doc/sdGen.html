<b>Styler</b> improves both the aesthetics and the behavior
of some OS/2 Presentation Manager controls and of the system in
general.
<p>
The <b>Shutdown</b> settings notebook controls the enhancements of
the system shutdown.

<p>
The enhanced confirmation dialog allows you to perform various kinds of
power management or system shutdown. You can define a list of
<a href="sdPrograms.html">programs to be executed</a> on shutdown,
maintain a list of processes <a href="sdTerm.html">to be terminated</a>
automatically (for certain programs which do not respond properly to the
system shutdown request), and optionally enable
<a href="sdReboot.html">rebooting</a> the system to a specific boot
volume.

<p>
<b>Enable extended shutdown</b> activates the enhanced shutdown features.
When this option is checked all the depending dialog controls and notebook
tabs get enabled.

<p>
The <a href="sdOptions.html">
<b>Include the following shutdown options</b></a> group provides
a list of actions optionally displayed in the shutdown dialog:
<ul>
<li>When <b>Animate the shutdown dialog</b> is checked, an animation will
introduce the shutdown confirmation dialog by gradually darkening the screen.
<li>The <b>Animation steps</b>
spin button controls the animation speed: the more steps, the longer
the time taken by the animation.
<li>When <b>Capture mouse pointer</b> is checked, the mouse will be prevented from
moving outside the shutdown options dialog. Enabling this option has been known
to cause problems with some remote desktop control utilities.
</ul>
