The <b>Push button enhancements</b> checkbox controls if the push button
enhancements are to be applied to the system.
When it is checked various options are available to customize the look
of all the push buttons.
<ul>
<li><b>Thick border</b> controls the thickness of the buttons border.
<li><b>Flat border</b> gives all the buttons a non-raised look
<li><b>Override non-default colors</b> forces all the buttons to
use the default push button color ignoring non-default colors set
by the user or the programmers.
<li><b>3D style default buttons</b> changes the emphasis of the
default buttons (i.e. those buttons which are activated as soon as the
user presses the <i>Enter</i> key) from the default 2 pixels solid color
border to a 1 pixel 2 colors border with a 3D depressed effect.
<li><b>3D style disabled buttons</b>
controls the look of the disabled buttons. When this option is selected,
the text of the disabled buttons is painted with a 3D effect, otherwise
the disabled buttons are just overpainted with a grey pattern.
<li>When <b>Solid color background</b> is checked
the buttons background is painted as a solid color rather
than as an image.
<br>
When this checkbox is unchecked another subset of controls are available
to select what image to use as button background.<br>
The <b>Background image</b> drop down lists the images currently
available in the Styler bitmaps folder.<br>
The <b>Add a new image</b> button allows to import a new
bitmap file into the Styler bitmaps folder via the standard
file dialog.<br>
Valid bitmap files are OS/2 bitmaps of any format up to 256 colors
and smaller than 64 KB.<br>
If the bitmap file is an array of bitmaps only the first bitmap is
taken into account.
</ul>
