<br>
The <b>shutdown programs</b> feature may be used for
<b>saving all the system files</b>.
For that purpose, create a text file listing all the relevant system files.
For instance (supposing that D: is your boot drive):<pre>
d:\os2\*.ini
d:\desktop
d:\config.sys
d:\autoexec.bat
d:\os2\dll\*.cfg
</pre>
After having saved the file, for instance as FILES.LST, enter in the Program
field:<pre>
CMD.EXE
</pre>
and in the Parameters field:<pre>
/C TYPE D:\FILES.LST | ZIP -rS9 D:\SYSTEM.SAV -@ 2>>D:\SYSSAV.LOG 1>>&amp;2
</pre>
This will create, in the root of the drive D:, a ZIP file, named SYSTEM.SAV,
containing all the files specified in D:\FILES.LST while the file SYSSAV.LOG
will register all the command output.
<br>Now, you can create a simple CMD file in the root of the boot drive:<pre>
@echo off
d:
cd\
unzip -o d:\system.sav
</pre>
saving it, for instance, as RECSYS.CMD.
<br>If it ever happens that you can't reboot your system because the system
files are corrupted, or the WarpCenter lost its configuration data,
you just have to boot
to a command line and run RECSYS.CMD to recover you previous system
configuration.
<p><b>Note:</b> This will not allow to save exactly the last state
of the system since some files (e.g. OS2.INI) are not updated
synchronously.
