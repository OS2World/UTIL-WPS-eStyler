Usually, when no other kind of font has been explicitly specified by
the programmer, all dialog windows use the <i>System Proportional</i>
font.
<p>
Styler allows you to override this behaviour by forcing dialog windows
to use the system window text font (as defined in the current desktop
scheme). Enable this behaviour by selecting the <b>Use &lt;font&gt;
for dialog windows</b> checkbox.
<p>
You can use the OS/2 Scheme Palette to define or change the window text
font.
<p>
If no window text font is defined in the scheme, a <b>...</b> button
will be shown here, allowing you to select a dialog font to use.
<p>
This will work in all dialog windows which have no explicit font defined.
Selecting the <b>Override non-default fonts</b> checkbox will also force
dialog windows which specify an explicit font to use the window text font
instead, subject to the limitation noted below.
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>
Individual controls on a dialog will inherit the font attribute (presentation
parameter) from the dialog window itself, <i>unless</i> they have been
explicitly set to use a different font. In this latter case, the Styler font
feature will not apply to them. Also note that this feature only affects
dialog windows, and not other types of windows (such as frames and client
windows)
