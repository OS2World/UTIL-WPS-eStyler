The border settings are quite simple. The <b>Show the titlebar border</b>
checkbox selects if the titlebar has to be surrounded by a border.
<p>
Two different colors are used for the titlebar border in order to achieve
a 3D visual effect.
The <b>Left/top color</b> and the <b>Right/bottom color</b> buttons allow to
choose what color to use for that purpose. While the <b>Swap colors</b>
button changes the effect from depressed to raised according to the
currently selected colors.<br>
Of course is always possible to avoid the 3D effect by setting
the same color in both buttons.
<p>
The preview window, as usual, is dynamically updated according to the
selected options.
